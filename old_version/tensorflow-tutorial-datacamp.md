### Feature Extraction

convert the images that are held in the images array to grayscale. You’ll do this color conversion mainly because the color matters less in classification questions like the one you’re trying to answer now. For detection, however, the color does play a big part! 

对于分类问题，颜色不是太重要，可以将图转成灰度图。但是，对于检测，颜色是很重要的。
